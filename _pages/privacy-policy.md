Westcor Land Title Insurance Company (”WLTIC”) values its customers and is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information. In keeping with that philosophy, we have developed a Privacy Policy, set out below, that will ensure the continued protection of your nonpublic personal information and inform you about the measures WLTIC takes to safeguard that information.

<b>Who is Covered</b>

Our Privacy Policy applies to each customer who purchases a WLTIC title insurance policy. Typically, this means that the customer covered by our Privacy Policy at the closing of the real estate transaction.

<b>Information Collected</b>

In the normal course of business and to provide the necessary services to our customers, we may obtain nonpublic personal information directly from the customer, from customer-related transactions, or from third parties such as our title insurance agents, lenders, appraisers, surveyors or other similar entities.

<b>Access to Information</b>

Access to all nonpublic personal information is limited to those employees who have a need to know in order to perform their jobs. These employees include, but are not limited to, those in departments such as legal, underwriting, claims administration and accounting.

<b>Information Sharing</b>

It is the policy of WLTIC not to share nonpublic personal information that it collects with anyone other than ou policy issuing agents as necessary to complete the real estate settlement services and issue the title insurance policy requested by our customer. WLTIC may share nonpublic personal information as permitted by law with entities with whom WLTIC has a joint marketing agreement. Entities with whom WLTIC has a joint marketing agreement have agreed to protect the privacy of our customer’s nonpublic personal information by utilizing similar precautions and security measures to those that WLTIC uses to protect this information and only to use the information for lawful purposes. WLTIC, however, may share information as required by law in response to a subpoena, to a government regulatory agency or to prevent fraud.

<b>Information Security</b>

WLTIC, at all times, strives to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the personal information in its possession and has instituted measures to guard against its unauthorized access. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with federal standards to protect that information.
